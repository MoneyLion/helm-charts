This Helm library chart exposes methods that an application chart can use to deploy applications with a standard set of k8s manifests using very little configuration in the consuming project's codebase. 
The main pattern of consumption requires invoking the banking-library-chart.standardapplication method, but more custom k8s manifest setups can be achieved by directly invoking the library's methods named after the type of manifest they create.

Helpful commands:
1. Retrieve the required dependencies for the banking-datawarehouse chart from within the charts directory: `helm dependency update ./banking-datawarehouse` 
2. Use the staging-values.yaml file to generate the expected yaml for the banking-datawarehouse chart from the charts directory: `helm template -f ./banking-datawarehouse/staging-values.yaml --name-template banking-datawarehouse banking-datawarehouse`
3. Show the values expected to be used for a helm chart: `helm show values banking-datawarehouse`
